// Add hideCloseButton to DialogContent if not available, or manually style it
// For now, assuming DialogContent might not have hideCloseButton,
// the user would have to manually close it or it vanishes on redirect.
// A better UX is for it not to have a close button.
// If DialogContent doesn't support hiding the close X, we might need to customize DialogContent component
// or accept that the X will be there briefly.
// For simplicity, this example assumes the X might be visible or DialogContent is extended.
// A common pattern is DialogPrimitive.Close being absent in such ephemeral dialogs.
// Let's assume for now the default X is there but redirect is quick.
// Update: Shadcn DialogContent includes a close button by default.
// To hide it, we can simply not render <DialogClose /> or DialogPrimitive.Close
// However, since we use the default DialogContent, it will have one.
// We can add a custom prop like `hideCloseButton` to our DialogContent if needed,
// or for this specific dialog, we can use a more basic overlay if that's simpler.
// Given the constraints, we'll proceed with the standard dialog.
// The redirect should be fast enough that it's not a major issue.
// I will remove the DialogPrimitive.Close from the DialogContent component.
// Actually, DialogContent has the close button built-in.
// I will add a prop to `DialogContent` called `hideCloseButton` and handle it there.
// This is not possible without modifying the ui/dialog.tsx file itself.
// A simpler way for this specific dialog:
// Just keep the standard dialog. The redirect will close it.
// For a cleaner look, I will make its content simple and centered.
